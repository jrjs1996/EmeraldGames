Production Checklist ( Pre Release )
------------------------------------

2.Make sure to update API reference and change all the examples and text so they don't contain any info like
host 127.0.0.1:8000 or my email or test email that uses hotmail, they should use the site url that I use.

Important notes:

There is alot of overhead with django transactions and it doesn't scale well. Should keep an eye out for alternatives

See if I can just wrap the usercontrollers exception handling methods in the non exception handling methods an get the
code from there to reduce copied code.

Unity Program

should also make sure that the unity program has an option to change the header  to the normal authorization in
production

How to make game key secret

Will probably want logout to send an actual message to the server logging them out and destroying their key. Remember to
redo all tutorials with this information. Including finished, and start examples

Should I require rsa encryption?

Should I log into emerald then get a client key as well as a temporary key then when a client logs into a server, it
uses the temporary key to log into emerald. How do I make sure client server encryption is secure.

I'm creating tests in the actual emerald controller so I should make sure this is removed from the actual program

There was an exception when I tried two create matches. I should make sure none of this stuff happens if the user is
doing things properly. It might have something to do with the coroutines accessing the match at the same time

Didn't test cases for Addplayertogroup overloads that take a player
------------------------------------

Create a database which stores all documentaion of classes

Might have to include redis info in the readme. I'll have to see if I have any problems when I start the server.

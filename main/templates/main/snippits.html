                        <h4>Classic Casual</h4>
                        <p>Casual is a game mode that uses a configuration which sets the default player maximum to 20. The configuration sets various other game settings also which applies only to the casual game mode. Casual game mode has 10 players on each team on either bomb defusal or hostage rescue maps. Just like competitive match making, casual is also match making. It puts some emphasis on players of equal skill group, the players then join one server that matches the criterias, however players of lower or higher skill group can also be invited to the server and be able to play. Unlike other game modes though, the casual game mode is limited to a maximum of 8 rounds. Although casual mode has no half time, players are free to switch sides during the game, provided there is room on the opposing team. The first team to win 8 rounds in total will win the match, with no possibility of a tie. Casual matches used to end prematurely when a map change vote would have succeeded, which would also have cancelled out any active mission points gained during a match. But there was a patch made by Valve CS:GO developers that now prevents such actions and will prevent abuse of the vote functions. </p>

                        <h4>Classic Competitive</h4>
                        <p>Unlike casual mode, competitive mode always pits two teams of 5 against each other in a 30 round match. The roundtime is 1 minute 55 seconds and the bomb timer is 40 seconds. It is not possible to switch sides during the game except at the halftime. After the first 15 rounds, the game reaches halftime and the two teams will switch sides. The first team to score 16 points wins the game. If both teams score a total of 15 points by the end of the 30th round, the match will end in a tie. Games can also end prematurely if one team surrenders to the other. A vote to surrender must be unanimously agreed upon, and the vote is locked until a team member abandons the match.</p>

                        <h4>Arms Race</h4>
                        <p>The ultimate goal in Arms Race is to score a kill with the Gold Knife. There is no time limit, buy menus are unavailable, money will not be rewarded for any reason, and weapons cannot be thrown away but will disappear as soon as the player dies. Instead, players spawn with the weapon on his or her current level as well as the knife. For every two kills on a particular level, the player will receive a new weapon by leveling up to the next level. The gold knife is the final weapon a player receives, and the first player to score a kill with the gold knife wins the game along with his or her team.</p>

                        <p>Buy menus are unavailable and money will not be rewarded, weapons cannot be thrown away and will disappear as soon as their user dies. Instead, all players start a round with the weapon on their current level, the knife, a defusal kit (as a CT), and a Terrorist player is randomly given the C4. Any players who made a (non-teamkill) kill that round will receive a new weapon in the next round, going down the arrangement of weapons and losing their weapon used in the last round.</p>

                        <h4>Deathmatch</h4>
                        <p>Prior to Global Offensive, several deathmatch mods were available, giving players the option to have a free-for-all deathmatch or team deathmatch elimination or point-based team deathmatch. Global Offensive's deathmatch mode, introduced on November 12, 2012, is a team deathmatch without any primary objectives, such as planting/defusing the bomb or rescuing hostages. Instead, players are required to eliminate enemies on the opposing team. After 10 minutes have elapsed, the round is over and the player with the most points will be displayed as the winner alongside 2nd and 3rd place.</p>
